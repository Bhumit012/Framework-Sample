# Create Framework Demo

How to make a custom SDK in XCode.

## Getting started

Steps to create an SDK:

Start by creating a new project and make it a framework.

Add some files and classes to the main folder.

Go to the project target and add a random library (e.g. acceleration) to create a Products folder in the project, which will be used to export the SDK. (Remove the random library after the Products folder is generated by Xcode.)

Select any iOS device for the build option so that the SDK can be built on any device. Then, build the project (Command + B).

Once built, go to the Products folder, select "Show in Finder", and copy and paste the SDK somewhere.

Steps to import the SDK:

Go to any project, and drag and drop the SDK inside it (hit "Copy items if needed").

Go to the project settings, and on the General tab, make sure the SDK is embedded without signing in.

There may be some issues with the architectures when building, so make sure to add the respective architectures. Go to the project settings, select "Build settings", and go to the rows: "Build active architecture only" and select "NO". In the "Architectures" row, add the architectures (armv7, armv7s, arm64, arm64e, x86_64) to support all devices and simulator architectures.

Build the project and import the SDK to use it!

# Benefits

Create a shared codebase SDK with private logic for easier maintenance and management of the codebase.
